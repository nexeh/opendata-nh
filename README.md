# Open Data New Hampshire

> Open data is data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by
anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike.

This project is a collection of all civic data and state-wide data that is made
available freely online by the government. The goal is to provide a place where
people can get ideas on how to make creative use of public data.

Example of data include:
*  Geographic Information System files (GIS) - Which include maps and things like
   polling locations
*  Budgets - Especial in a spreadsheet format like Excel or CSV
*  Audio and Video Records - Such as town meetings
*  Meeting notes
*  Legislative data - Such as bills and voting records
*  Schedules - Such as public transit times
*  Real-time data - Such as sensors
*  Event calendars
*  Police and fire logs
*  Parking information
*  Weather information
*  Etc.

## Goal

The goal is to provide a place where people can get ideas on how to make creative use of public data.

We can do this by:
- Creating a human readable index of all open New Hampshire data
- Creating a computer readable index of the data that people can use in their
- For large data sets, creating scrapers or use APIs to get complete lists of
  available data
- Indexing the data and make it available online

Passed during the FY2012 Legislative Session, [RSA 21-R:10-14](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/NHTOC/NHTOC-I-21-R.htm) requires state agencies to consider open source software when acquiring software and promotes the use of open data formats by state agencies. Over time, the implementation of open standards compliant products can reduce the cost of software ownership and ensure long-term data accessibility and interoperability.

Creating apps that use the data is outside the scope of this project.

### WISDOM - Public health data dashboard

**Link**: [WISDOM - Public health data dashboard](https://wisdom.dhhs.nh.gov/wisdom/)

**Description**: NH Health WISDOM provides access to data for hundreds of public health indicators via interactive dashboards and community profiles. Up to date data in maps, graphs, and tables related to the NH State Health Improvement Plan Adobe Acrobat Reader Symbol, NH Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, and the NH Occupational Health Surveillance Program.

**Notes**: This sees to be a new service the state is providing and they are looking to expand more. They also seem to be looking for input and feedback. This might be a place for us to partner up. There also seems to be some backend java services for getting data. We might beable to suggest exposing it as an API for project consumption.
